Venture Plan improves the Command Table interface for covenant adventures.

The Available Adventures list provides more detail about more adventures than the default UI, requiring less scrolling.
You can quickly receive rewards from completed adventures, and set up tentative parties for multiple adventures before committing your companions.
The Companions/Troop list on the adventure details page no longer requires scrolling.
Adventurer and enemy ability tooltips display targetting information, and in some cases correct misleading original ability descriptions.
The included Cursed Adventurer's Guide is able to foretell your companions' gruesome demise before you send them off on an impossible mission, while the Cursed Tactical Guide can suggest troops and optimize adventuring party layouts to minimize health loss. The guides have been tested on tens of millions of adventures, and are probably the most reliable predictors of mission outcomes. Nevertheless, bug-for-bug replication of the adventures combat logic is a bit difficult, and so the guides may be misleading in some very rare circumstances.

Note: Venture Plan has not been updated for patch 9.1; the guides may not always provide correct predictions. A 9.1-compatible continuation is currently planned.
